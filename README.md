I can't directly see the code you're using since it appears as an image, but based on the content, I can offer some suggestions to improve your readme and make it visually appealing:

Visuals:

MasterHead: While the current image might be informative, consider using a cleaner and more professional-looking logo or avatar.
Coding Image (Right Aligned): The image on the right with the code snippet can be replaced with a simpler visual representing coding or computer science. You can find free icons on websites like Noun Project: https://thenounproject.com/.
Coding Animated Gif (Right Aligned): The animated gif can be distracting. Consider replacing it with a static image or using it very subtly.
Text Formatting:

Left/Right Alignment: Instead of everything being centered, use left-alignment for most of the text content. This improves readability.
Emojis: Emojis are fine, but using too many might come across as unprofessional. Consider using them sparingly.
Structure:

Conciseness: Short and impactful descriptions are better.
Whitespace: Add space between sections for better readability.
Here's a possible improved structure:
